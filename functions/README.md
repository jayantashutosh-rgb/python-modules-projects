# Python Functions & Functional Programming — PW Assignment

This folder contains my completed PW Skills assignment on Python Functions and Functional Programming.

The notebooks demonstrate strong understanding of function design, iteration techniques, and functional-style problem solving using clean, readable, and well-documented Python code.

---

##  Concepts Covered

The assignment focuses on the following topics:

- Defining and calling Python functions
- Function arguments and return values
- Loop-based iteration
- Iterators and generators
- Lambda expressions
- Functional programming utilities such as:
  - map()
  - filter()
  - reduce()
- Handling edge cases and writing efficient logic
- Writing reusable and modular code

---

##  What This Assignment Demonstrates

- Clear problem decomposition into functions  
- Proper naming conventions and documentation  
- Real-world style coding practices  
- Logical thinking and step-by-step implementations  
- Interview-oriented problem solving approach  

Each solution is written in a way that reflects production-level thinking rather than simple practice scripts.

##  Purpose of This Work

This assignment was created as part of my Python learning journey and is intended to showcase:

- My understanding of core Python concepts  
- My ability to solve structured programming problems  
- My readiness to build larger backend or data analytics systems in the future
