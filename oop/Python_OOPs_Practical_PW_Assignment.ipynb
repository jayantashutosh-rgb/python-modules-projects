    "# Python OOPs – Theory Answers (1–25)\n",
    "\n",
    "1) What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around *objects* rather than only functions and procedures. Each object represents a real-world entity and is created from a class. OOP is built on four main principles: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. This approach helps developers build large systems in smaller independent modules, reuse existing code, reduce duplication, and maintain applications easily over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "A class is a blueprint or design template used to create objects. It defines two main things: the *attributes* (data or properties) that an object will store, and the *methods* (functions or behaviors) that describe what the object can do. Without a class, objects cannot be constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "An object is a real instance of a class that occupies memory in the computer system. While a class only describes structure, an object contains actual values for the attributes and can interact with other objects through its methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "Abstraction focuses on exposing only necessary features of a system while hiding internal complexity and implementation details from the user. Encapsulation, on the other hand, means bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into one unit (a class) and protecting the data from being modified directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5) What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "Dunder methods (double underscore methods) are special built-in methods in Python that start and end with two underscores, such as __init__, __str__, __len__, and __add__. These methods allow programmers to define how objects behave with standard Python operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "Inheritance is an OOP mechanism in which a child class automatically acquires attributes and methods from a parent class. This enables code reuse, reduces repetition, and allows developers to extend existing functionality or customize behavior in derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7) What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "Polymorphism means “many forms.” It allows a single method name to work differently depending on the object type that is calling it. Different classes may implement the same method but with their own specific logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8) How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "Encapsulation in Python is achieved using naming conventions such as _variable (protected) and __variable (private). These conventions discourage direct access to data. Instead, public methods are provided to safely read or update the internal state of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9) What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "A constructor is a special method named __init__ that is executed automatically when a new object is created. It initializes the object’s attributes and sets them to meaningful starting values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10) What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator and receive the class itself as the first parameter (cls). They usually operate on class-level data. Static methods are defined with @staticmethod and do not receive any reference to the object or class; they are utility functions logically related to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11) What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "Method overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Python does not support traditional method overloading, but similar functionality can be created using default values or variable-length arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12) What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "Method overriding happens when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method already defined in the parent class. When the method is called through the child object, Python executes the overridden version instead of the parent’s version.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13) What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "The @property decorator allows a method to be accessed like an attribute instead of calling it with parentheses. It is widely used to create controlled access to private variables by defining getter, setter, and deleter functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14) Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "Polymorphism allows systems to be flexible and extensible. The same method call can work with different object types, reducing conditional statements and making code easier to maintain and expand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "15) What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is intended only for inheritance. It usually defines abstract methods that must be implemented in derived classes, ensuring that all child classes follow a common structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16) What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "OOP provides benefits such as modular program structure, code reuse, scalability, easier debugging and maintenance, improved data security, and realistic modeling of complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17) What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "A class variable is shared among all instances of a class, meaning every object accesses the same value. An instance variable belongs to a specific object, so each instance can store different data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "18) What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit features from more than one parent class. While powerful, it must be used carefully to avoid ambiguity and complex method resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "19) Explain the purpose of '__str__' and '__repr__' methods in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "The __str__ method returns a user-friendly string representation of an object, mainly for display. The __repr__ method returns a detailed representation for developers and debugging, ideally one that could recreate the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "20) What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "The super() function is used to access parent class methods or constructors inside a child class. It supports Python’s method resolution order and avoids explicitly naming the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "21) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "The __del__ method is called a destructor and is executed when Python’s garbage collector removes an object. It is generally used to release external resources such as files or network connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "22) What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "A static method behaves like a normal function inside a class and does not receive the object or class reference. A class method receives the class itself as the first argument and is commonly used for alternative constructors or class-level operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "23) How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "In inheritance-based polymorphism, a subclass overrides a parent method. At runtime, Python determines which version of the method to execute based on the object’s actual class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "24) What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "Method chaining is calling multiple methods on the same object in one statement. This is possible when every method returns the same instance (self), enabling a clean and fluent coding style.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "25) What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer  \n",
    "The __call__ method allows an object of a class to behave like a function. When parentheses are used with an instance, Python internally triggers the __call__ method.\n"
