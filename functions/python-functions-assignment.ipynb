    "Q1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a reusable block of code that is defined independently using the def keyword. It can be called directly in a program and is not attached to any specific object.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method is also a function, but it is defined inside a class and is associated with objects of that class. A method usually works on the data of the object and receives the object reference as its first parameter, which is commonly named self.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world projects, functions are often used for utility logic, calculations, or data processing, while methods represent behaviors of objects such as users, accounts, or orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "class Calculator:\n",
    "    def add(self, a, b):\n",
    "        return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "calc = Calculator()\n",
    "calc.add(2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function is defined, the variable names written inside the parentheses are called parameters. These parameters act as placeholders for the values that will be passed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the function is called, the actual values provided to the function are called arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation allows the same function to work with different inputs and makes code reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(name)\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(\"Ashutosh\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides several flexible ways to define and call functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can receive positional arguments, where values are passed in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keyword arguments can also be used, where argument names are explicitly mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Default arguments allow some parameters to have predefined values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are short one-line anonymous functions used for simple logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def power(x, y=2):\n",
    "    return x ** y\n",
    "\n",
    "power(5)\n",
    "power(x=3, y=3)\n",
    "\n",
    "square = lambda n: n * n\n",
    "square(6)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches are widely used when writing configurable programs, scripts, and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is the purpose of the return statement in a Python function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The return statement is used to send a computed value back to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also stops further execution inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return values make it possible to reuse the output of one function in another calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def multiply(a, b):\n",
    "    return a * b\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Without return, a function may perform actions but will not provide usable output for later processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterable is any object that can be looped over, such as lists, tuples, strings, or sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator is an object that produces values one at a time and keeps track of the current position during iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterable creates an iterator using the iter() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator returns the next element using the next() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "it = iter(nums)\n",
    "next(it)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is important in data processing tasks where large collections should not be loaded entirely into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are special functions that generate values one at a time instead of returning all results together.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are defined like normal functions but use the yield keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time a generator yields a value, the function pauses and remembers its state.\n",
    "\n",
    "When called again, it continues execution from the same point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def countdown(n):\n",
    "    while n > 0:\n",
    "        yield n\n",
    "        n -= 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are commonly used in ETL pipelines, file streaming, and large-scale data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are memory efficient because they do not store all values at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "They work well with very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "They support lazy evaluation, meaning values are created only when required.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are useful in streaming and pipeline-based systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "These qualities make generators highly valuable in professional data workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
    "\n",
    "A lambda function is a small anonymous function written in a single line using the lambda keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is typically used when the logic is simple and temporary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are often used with map(), filter(), and sorting operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "They help keep code concise and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "square = lambda x: x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The map() function applies a given function to every element of an iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It returns a new iterable containing the transformed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This avoids writing explicit loops and supports a functional programming style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "result = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, nums))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Map() is widely used in analytics pipelines for transforming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What is the difference between map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "map() is used to transform each element of an iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "filter() is used to select only those elements that satisfy a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "reduce() is used to combine all elements of an iterable into a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "list(map(lambda x: x * 2, nums))\n",
    "list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums))\n",
    "reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, nums)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions are frequently used in preprocessing and aggregation tasks."
